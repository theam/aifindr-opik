class FollowsCriteria(base_metric.BaseMetric):
    """
    A metric that evaluates whether an LLM's output follows specified criteria based on a prompt template.

    This metric uses another LLM to judge if the output adheres to the criteria defined in the prompt template.
    It returns a score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates full compliance with the criteria.

    Args:
        prompt_template: The template string containing the base prompt where the specific item criteria will be inserted. It must contain the varaible "{criteria}" and "{output}" somewhere
        name: The name of the metric. Defaults to "Follows criteria"
        model_name: The name of the LLM model to use for evaluation. Defaults to "gpt-4"

    Example:
        >>> from metrics import FollowsCriteria
        >>> prompt_template = "You should follow the criteria listed here: {criteria}. The response to evaluate is: {output}" 
        >>> # Assuming criteria is "The response should be a country"
        >>> metric = FollowsCriteria(prompt_template=prompt_template)
        >>> result = metric.score('Spain')
        >>> print(result.value)
        1.0
        >>> print(result.reason)
        The output perfectly follows the criteria by providing the name of the country Spain

Answer with a json with the following format:

{{{{
    "score": <score float number between 0.0 and 1.0>,
    "reason": "<reason for the score>"
}}}}

Follow this instructions to fill the score:
- **0.0**: The response does not follow the criteria at all.
- **0.1 - 0.3**: The response is somewhat related to the criteria, but it doesn't follow it.
- **0.4 - 0.6**: The response partially follows the criteria, following some points, but not others. Or those points that follow are only partially correct.
- **0.7 - 0.9**: The response either fulfills all criteria but it is lacking details or misses between 10-30% of the criteria points.
- **1.0**: The response perfectly follows the criteria completely.
